Setup for our project:
1) Navigate to the root directory .../Parser-Project-AuraMen/project
2) In the root directory run the command to compile the project `javac -cp "lib/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar:generated/grammar" -d bin src/ParserProject.java generated/grammar/*.java`
3) Once compiling is finished run the command `java -cp "lib/antlr-4.9.2-complete.jar:bin" ParserProject` in the root directory once again


Versions Required: Latest updated Java and ANTLR

Explanation: This Parser Project involves creating a custom parser using Java using the Context Free grammar and the tool ANTLR. The parser should generate a parse tree and handle the Java. The project has three deliverables, Deliverable 1 being the arithmetic and assignment operators, deliverable 2 being the conditional and logical conditions and statements and deliverable 3 will have the loops, nested structures, and comments.
